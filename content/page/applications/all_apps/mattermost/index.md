# Team Collaboration

![](./img/mattermost_header.png)
<br/>

*You can access the Team Collaboration solution on the ThreeFold Now Marketplace directly [here](https://marketplace.threefold.io/marketplace/#/solutions/mattermost). Please note that the marketplace is currently running on testnet.*

With the world moving more and more into remote working, the team collaboration platforms are becoming highly-important. There are some well-known tools out there but they come with the downfalls of many centralized solutions – lack of security and privacy, and operating in closed source environments.

## Open Source Solution: Mattermost

[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) is an widely-trusted open source and self-hosted Slack alternative – a messaging platform that enables secure team collaboration.

## Why use Mattermost?

Remote team collaboration is growing in importance these days and while other solutions exist (e.g. Slack), we recommend using this open source and secure alternative on top of the ThreeFold Grid.

It brings the all the communication features you need, including:

 - Organized conversations in teams and channels
 - Fully searchable message history
 - 1-on-1 and group messaging
 - Voice, video, and screen sharing
 - File, image, and link sharing
 - Emoji and rich Markdown formatting
 - Multi-language support

And has important integrated tools like:

 - DevOps integration set
 - Incoming and outgoing webhooks
 - Custom slash commands
 - Robust API library

Basically, you won't lose out on [the key functionalities](https://mattermost.com/product/) you might be used to with other alternative and you **gain** privacy and security.

Bonus! Mattermost has integration features with [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), which is also part of the ThreeFold Now suite.

## Tutorial: How to Deploy

- First, visit [the Team Collaboration solution](https://marketplace.threefold.io/marketplace/#/solutions/mattermost) live on the marketplace

- Once you enter this information, all you need to do is wait for the solution to deploy. You can keep an eye on the screen for progress.
- Upon completion, you'll see a link to view your solution live and it will remain live in your My Workloads section for three hours.
