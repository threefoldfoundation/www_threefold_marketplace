## Joint Mission


## About 


## Polygon and ThreeFold

Polygon and ThreeFold joined forces to provide key benefits in successfully running a validator node and other related IT workloads on the Polygon Blockchain, which are primarily the ease-of-deployment, customization, privacy, and monitoring.

- By leveraging the ThreeFold P2P Cloud and 3Bot, the Polygon's community – developers and non-developes – receive all of these benefits.
- They can easily get started and run their own validators nodes for their staking directly from the web, and in just a few clicks. 
- Together we will expand Polygon's community-led Blockchain across the geographical edges, while creating a more inclusive and cost-effective participation model for anybody on earth to be involved in the growing Matic ecosystem. 

## Get started with Polygon

**Coming soon:** You will be able to soon deploy a Matic validator node via the **ThreeFold Now Marketplace**'s dashboard in a few clicks.
